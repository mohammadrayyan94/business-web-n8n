Neurostack — Single-page marketing site

Files:
- index.html — single-page site (hero, services, contact)
- main.css — theme and layout (dark blue / black aesthetic)
- script.js — small canvas background animation and year injector

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).
2. For local development with a simple static server (recommended), run a static server from the folder. Example (PowerShell):

   python -m http.server 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes & next steps:
- The site is intentionally single-page and responsive.
- You can replace the content text in `index.html` with your exact copy.
- If you prefer the stylesheet named `styles.css`, either remove or fix the corrupted `styles.css` and rename `main.css` accordingly.
- I can add a contact form (Netlify functions, Formspree, or a simple mailto) if you want.
